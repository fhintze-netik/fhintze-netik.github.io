        <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
        <p>
          I am a software development apprentice with a great passion for
          programming, video games and motorcycles. I'm getting trained in
          developing efficient and user-friendly solutions and have experience
          in C#, AL, HTML, CSS, object-oriented design, and a little bit of
          JavaScript. I enjoy taking on complex challenges and developing
          innovative applications that improve the user experience. I'm keen to
          expand my knowledge and learn about new topics or technologies and
          apply them to develop good, robust solutions that meet both technical
          requirements and user preferences.

            <h4>UI Design</h4>
            <p>
              When I started my apprenticeship, I first started with backend
              development but after a short time I was already interested in UI
              design. This portfolio is my first independently built UI with the
              help of a tutorial.

            <h4>Frontend Development</h4>
            <p>
              In the course of this portfolio and my other training, I have
              already learned a lot about the front end. Through various
              projects and tasks I was able to further my education and I always
              enjoy writing frontend-related lines.

            <h4>Backend Development</h4>
            <p>
              However, the most exciting area of development for me remains in
              the backend. This is where I've had the most to do so far. I'm
              still at the beginning of my training and can't keep up with
              experience yet, but I make up for that with motivation.

          <h3>Card Game</h3>
          <p>
            One of the tasks I was given as part of my training was to develop a
            card game. The aim of the game was to collect as many sets of four
            matching cards as possible. I worked through the entire process of
            programming the game, from the planning phase to the final
            implementation. For this project, I specifically used C# and
            utilized its object-oriented functions to manage the logic and
            components of the game. It was really fun to program.

          <h3>Timer</h3>
          <p>
            As part of my apprenticeship, I developed a simple console
            application timer using C#. The application grants the users the
            ability to start, pause, and reset a timer, with the ability to save
            already finished recordings. It was a great way to improve my skills
            in backend development, specifically in C#, while learning about
            time management and logic implementation. This project gave me
            hands-on experience with developing console applications and helped
            me better understand backend programming. It also served as a
            foundation for future projects that involve more complex backend
            logic and user interaction.

          <h3>Fan Game</h3>
          <p>
            I was invited to join my first non-business related development team
            to work on a fan game written in Ruby. The Game itself is related to
            a big Japanese game and media franchise which I can't specify any
            further. The project tries to create an interactive, engaging
            experience for players of a specific genre by developing game
            mechanics, processing user input and ensuring smooth gameplay. It is
            an ongoing project where I continue to develop my Ruby skills and
            work with the team to improve the game and myself. With this project
            I continued to build my knowledge about teamwork, communication and
            problem solving in a friendly development environment, and I'm
            excited to continue this project since it will hit alpha phase in a
            couple of months.

          <h3>Portfolio</h3>
          <p>
            As one of the tasks of my training, I created this portfolio. It
            allowed me to gain my first experience with HTML, CSS and
            JavaScript. The basis of this website was written and subdivided
            using HTML. For the design I decided to use the variety of functions
            of CSS, mostly I used flexbox in combination with hover effects,
            rounding and color combinations. Finally I used JavaScript to bring
            the buttons to life, the contact form for example, automatically
            creates a new entry in a Google Sheet for each submit.
